IMPLEMENTATION
The implementation of ProntoWeather involves a variety of key technologies and API services. It is designed with simplicity and speed in mind, as reflected in its minimalistic design and efficient use of resources.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: ProntoWeather is built using standard web technologies, ensuring compatibility with all modern web browsers.

Geocoding API: Used to convert the input location (in text format) into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).

Open-Meteo API: Used to fetch the current weather data and 7-day forecast for the given geographic coordinates.

User Input
The user can enter the location for which they want to know the weather details in the input field. As they type, the application provides autocomplete suggestions from the Geocode API for locations that match the typed text. The user can select a location from the suggestions or continue typing. When the user stops typing, the application automatically fetches and displays the weather data for the best matched location.


Weather Display
The application displays the current weather, temperature, wind speed and direction, and a 7-day forecast for the selected location. The weather data is fetched from the Open-Meteo API. The application also displays a background video that corresponds to the current weather condition.


User Interface
The user interface is straightforward and intuitive. A single text input field allows users to enter a location, with an auto-suggest feature that provides options based on what the user has typed so far. This auto-suggest feature leverages the GEOCODE_API to match typed text to known locations.

A loading icon is displayed while the application fetches data, providing a visual indication to the user that their request is being processed.

Once the weather data is fetched, it is displayed in a clean and easy-to-understand format, with separate sections for current weather, temperature, wind speed, and wind direction.

A 7-day forecast is also provided, offering average temperature, humidity, and wind speed for each day.


API Usage
The application uses two APIs to fetch and convert data:

Geocoding API (GEOCODE_API): This API is used to convert the user's text input into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).

Open Meteo API (OPEN_METEO_API): This API uses the latitude and longitude provided by the GEOCODE_API to fetch current and forecasted weather data.

The application uses fetch API to make requests to these APIs and handles responses asynchronously using promises.


Error Handling
The application has several error handling mechanisms in place. It catches and logs any errors that occur during the fetch API calls. It also checks the existence of current weather data before processing it, logging an error message if no data is available.


Weather Description and Video
The application uses a mapping of weather codes to descriptions to interpret the weathercode data from the API. It also chooses a video to display based on the current weather code.


Event Handling
The application makes use of various event listeners. For instance, the 'input' event on the location input field triggers the handleInput function, which initiates the process of fetching and displaying weather data. Other events like 'mousedown' and 'keydown' are also used to enhance user experience.


Forecast Calculation
The 7-day forecast is calculated by slicing the hourly data from the API into 24-hour segments, one for each day. For each day, it calculates the average temperature, humidity, and wind speed.



FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS
type(): This function controls the typing/deleting effect in the location input field. It cycles through an array of example locations, typing and deleting each one.

handleInput(event): This function is triggered when the user types in the location input field. It handles the delay before making the API request, shows the loading icon, and fetches the geocode information for the input location.

handleGeocodeResponse(data, typedLocation): This function handles the JSON response from the Geocoding API. It populates the autocomplete list with matching location suggestions, and then fetches and displays the weather data for the best-matched location.

fetchWeatherData(latitude, longitude): This function fetches the weather data for the converted latitude and longitude from the Open-Meteo API.

getWeatherDescription(code): This function returns a string description of the weather given a weather code.

getWeatherVideo(code): This function maps the weather code to a corresponding video file.

initializeVideoPlayer(videoFile): This function initializes the video player with the given video file.

handleWeatherResponse(weatherData): This function handles the response from the Open-Meteo API. It extracts the current weather data, calculates average values for the 7-day forecast, and updates the weather display and forecast display on the webpage.

FAQ
What is ProntoWeather?

ProntoWeather is a web application that provides current and forecasted weather data for any location around the world.


How do I use ProntoWeather?

Simply type the location you are interested in into the text field. The application will auto-suggest locations as you type. Select your desired location from the suggestions or finish typing, and the weather data will be automatically fetched and displayed.


What data does ProntoWeather provide?

ProntoWeather provides current weather, temperature, wind speed and direction, and a 7-day forecast.


Why am I seeing a loading icon?

The loading icon appears when the application is fetching data. It should disappear once the data has been fetched and processed.


Why does the location input field have changing suggestions?

The location input field has an auto-suggest feature that provides location suggestions based on what you have typed so far. This feature uses the Geocoding API to match your typed text to known locations.


Why can't I see the weather data?

If the weather data is not displaying, it might be because the application is still fetching the data (in which case the loading icon should be visible), or there might be an issue with the data source. The application logs any errors that occur during data fetch, so you can check the console for error messages.


What do the weather codes mean?

The weather codes are a way for the API to communicate the weather condition in a standardized way. The application has a mapping of these codes to descriptions, which it uses to interpret the weather code data from the API.


What is the video that plays in the background?

The video that plays in the background is chosen based on the current weather code. It provides a visual representation of the current weather condition.


How is the 7-day forecast calculated?

The 7-day forecast is calculated by slicing the hourly data from the API into 24-hour segments, one for each day. For each day, the application calculates the average temperature, humidity, and wind speed.


What are the sources of data for ProntoWeather?

ProntoWeather uses two APIs to fetch data: the Geocoding API to convert the user's text input into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), and the Open Meteo API to fetch current and forecasted weather data using these coordinates.
